# despawn.sh — tear down a spawned crew member, the inverse of spawn.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   despawn.sh <team> <from> <name> [--force] [--timeout <secs>]
#
#   <team>   team the member is in
#   <from>   the leader's own agent name (sender of the control message)
#   <name>   the member to tear down
#
# Default (graceful): send a `ctrl:despawn` control message to <name>. The
# member's watcher (watch.sh) sees it, drops its own role (releasing the actas
# lock) and closes its own tmux pane — ending its CLI. We block until the lock
# is released, up to --timeout (default 30s); on timeout the member didn't
# respond, so re-run with --force.
#
# --force: skip the message and tear the member down from here using the
# placement recorded at spawn time — kill its tmux pane/window and drop its
# registration. For when the member's watcher can't respond.
#
# See #109. Graceful teardown's full pane-close is tmux-only (the member needs a
# tmux pane to close); an OS-terminal member drops its role but its window must
# be closed by hand.
