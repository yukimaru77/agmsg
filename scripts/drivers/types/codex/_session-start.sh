# codex SessionStart plug — hand the session off to the Codex bridge.
#
# Sourced by session-start.sh in its global context (so it sees TYPE, PROJECT,
# RUN_DIR, SKILL_DIR, SCRIPT_DIR, PAIRS and the helpers agmsg_sha1,
# agmsg_sqlite_mem, agmsg_resolve_node, agmsg_canonical_path, agmsg_agent_pid).
# Defines agmsg_session_start, overriding session-start.sh's default no-op.
#
# Native Codex Monitor follows the common SessionStart -> Monitor -> watch.sh
# path. When launched through the legacy codex-monitor.sh wrapper, the TUI is
# attached to a shared app-server so incoming agmsg rows
# become turns in the current Codex thread without exposing socket/thread
# plumbing to the user. With AGMSG_CODEX_BRIDGE_LAUNCHER=1 (set by
# codex-monitor.sh) we only write a request file and let the out-of-sandbox
# launcher start the bridge — a hook-launched bridge cannot connect to the unix
# socket from inside the Codex sandbox (#41).

# Newest-N rollout files under $sessions_dir, sorted by mtime descending.
# `ls -t "$dir"/*/*/*/rollout-*.jsonl` is unreliable on Windows/Git Bash --
# reported to intermittently return an empty/truncated list with no
# filesystem changes in between (root cause unconfirmed, possibly an
# MSYS2 glob/large-arglist interaction), which silently starves
# agmsg_resolve_codex_thread of any candidate: the SessionStart hook just
# no-ops and the bridge never launches, with no error output at all. `find`
# is reported reliable there; do the mtime sort ourselves with the existing
# portable compat_file_mtime, since `find -printf` is GNU-only (no
# `-printf` on macOS/BSD find, which this repo also has to support). See #416.
agmsg_newest_rollout_files() {
  local dir="$1" limit="$2" f mtime
  # `head -n "$limit"` here would close its read end after $limit lines while
  # `sort` may still be writing -- under this caller's `set -euo pipefail`,
  # that SIGPIPEs `sort` (status 141) and pipefail surfaces it as the whole
  # pipeline's status even though head/cut both still exit 0. With enough
  # rollout files to exceed the pipe buffer (confirmed at ~20k candidate
  # lines in review), that silently starves the caller of a result -- the
  # exact class of bug this function exists to fix, reintroduced by a
  # different mechanism. awk reads its input through to EOF regardless of
  # `n` (only *printing* stops early), so `sort` is always fully drained and
  # never SIGPIPEd.
  # `|| true` on the mtime lookup: under set -e, a plain `var=$(cmd)`
  # assignment DOES abort on cmd's failure (unlike a substitution used inside
  # a test/conditional). A rollout that `find` listed but that Codex deletes
  # or rotates before `stat` runs on it (a real possibility across the ~1-2s
  # this loop can take with hundreds of files) would otherwise abort this
  # whole while-loop subshell -- another way to reintroduce the "no
  # candidate found" failure the ${mtime:-0} fallback below already exists to
  # avoid.
