name: __SKILL_NAME__
description: Cross-agent messaging via SQLite. Send messages between Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Grok Build, and other agents. No daemon, no network, no dependencies beyond bash and sqlite3.
---

Agent messaging command. **IMPORTANT: Always use the provided scripts. NEVER directly read or edit config files, DB, or team data. There is NO register.sh — use join.sh to join a team.**

## Identity

If you already know your AGENT and TEAMS from a previous `/__SKILL_NAME__` call in this session, skip to **Execute** below.

Otherwise, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/whoami.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build`

Four possible outputs:

**A) Single identity:**
`agent=<name> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path>`
→ Remember AGENT and TEAMS, then go to **Execute**.

**B) Multiple identities:**
`multiple=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path>`
→ Ask the user which agent name to use for this session, then go to **Execute**.

**C) Not in a team:**
`not_joined=true available_teams=<t1,t2,...>` (or `available_teams=none`)
→ Show the user the available teams from the output, then:

  > **First-time setup required.**
  > Joining a team so this agent can send and receive messages.
  > - **Team name**: a group of agents that can message each other (available: <list from output>)
  > - **Agent name**: this agent's identity within the team

  1. Ask: "Enter a team name (joins existing or creates new)"
  2. Ask: "Enter a name for this agent"
  3. **You MUST use join.sh** — run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
  4. Show the result and explain:

  > **Joined!** You can now use `/__SKILL_NAME__` to check and send messages.
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__` — check inbox
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ send <agent> <message>` — send a message
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ team` — list team members
  > - `/__SKILL_NAME__ history` — message history

  5. **REQUIRED — Do NOT skip this step.** Ask the user to pick a delivery mode using exactly this prompt:

     ```
     Choose delivery mode for incoming messages:

       1) turn    — Check inbox at the end of each assistant turn
                     A .grok/rules/agmsg.md rule has you self-check inbox.sh
                     each turn. Zero setup; no background watcher.

       2) monitor — Real-time push via a background watcher
                     Launches watch.sh through the `monitor` tool; each new
                     message streams in as a notification. You launch the watcher
                     explicitly (Grok hooks can't auto-start it at SessionStart).

       3) off     — No automatic delivery
                     Manual /__SKILL_NAME__ only.

     [1]:
     ```

     - **Wait for the user's answer before proceeding.** Empty input means `1` (turn).
     - Map the chosen number to a mode (`1`→`turn`, `2`→`monitor`, `3`→`off`) and run:
       `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
     - If you chose `monitor`, read the `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` block that `delivery.sh` prints and follow it now: invoke the `monitor` tool with the given `command` / `description` / `persistent: true` so the watcher starts streaming into this session. `both` is not supported.

  6. Then check inbox for the newly joined team.

**D) Suggestions for reuse:**
`suggest=true agents=<n1,n2,...> teams=<t1,t2,...> type=grok-build project=<path> available_teams=<t1,t2,...>`
→ No exact registration exists for this project, but there are same-type agent names registered elsewhere.

  1. Show the suggested agent names to the user.
  2. Ask whether to reuse one of those names or choose a new one.
  3. Ask for the team name to join (existing or new).
  4. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
  5. Then continue with the normal post-join flow above.

## Execute

**Only use scripts in `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/` — do not read or modify files under `teams/` or `db/` directly.**

**Ensure the monitor is running first (monitor mode only).** If the project's delivery mode is `monitor` (check via `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh status grok-build "$(pwd)"`) and no `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is running in this session yet, invoke the `monitor` tool now (before the subcommand below):

- command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "$GROK_SESSION_ID" "$(pwd)" grok-build`
- description: `agmsg inbox stream`
- persistent: true

Each output line is one message: `<ts> | <team> | <from> -> <to> | <body>`. React to messages as they arrive; reply with `send.sh`. Launch it only once — if a watcher is already streaming, do not start a second one. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher; skip this.

**Natural-language requests.** If the argument is not one of the exact command forms below but clearly asks to join, create, switch, or become an agmsg team/role, handle it instead of rejecting it. Examples: "join team backend as reviewer", "backendチームにreviewerとして入って", "別のチーム backend になって", "team backend, name reviewer".
1. Parse the requested `<team>` and `<agent_name>` when present.
2. If `<team>` is missing, ask for it. If `<agent_name>` is missing, use the current AGENT when exactly one identity is known; otherwise ask for the name.
3. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <agent_name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
4. Update this session's AGENT to `<agent_name>` and treat `<team>` as the preferred team for later ambiguous send/history/team commands.
5. Do not remove old team memberships unless the user explicitly asks to drop, reset, or leave; then use the existing drop/reset flow.
6. Show the result, then check inbox for the joined team with `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/inbox.sh <team> <agent_name>`.

**If no arguments provided (DEFAULT action — always do this when the command is invoked without arguments):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** run inbox check for each TEAM: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/inbox.sh $TEAM $AGENT`
2. Do NOT ask the user what to do — just run the inbox check.
3. If there are messages, read and respond appropriately. To reply:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "history":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/history.sh $TEAM $AGENT`

If argument is "team":
1. For each TEAM, run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/team.sh $TEAM`

If argument starts with "send" (e.g. "send misaki check the server"):
1. Parse target agent and message from the arguments
2. Determine which team the target agent belongs to, then run:
   `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/send.sh $TEAM $AGENT <to_agent> "<message>"`

If argument is "config":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh show`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "config set" (e.g. "config set hook.check_interval 30"):
1. Parse key and value from the arguments.
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/config.sh set <key> <value>`


If argument starts with "actas" followed by an agent name (e.g. "actas alice"):
1. Parse the new role name.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/identities.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build` to see whether the role is already registered for this (project, type).
3. If the name does not appear in the output, join under the existing team. For a single team, run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/join.sh <team> <name> grok-build "$(pwd)"`. For multiple teams, ask the user which team to join the new role into.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`**, switch the watcher to the new role so receive is restricted to it:
   a. If an `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is already running in this session, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent` on its task id.
   b. Launch a fresh watcher with the `monitor` tool (persistent):
      - command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "$GROK_SESSION_ID" "$(pwd)" grok-build <name>`
      - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
   The 4th argument restricts the subscription to messages addressed to `<name>` only. In `turn`/`off` mode there is no watcher to switch — skip this step.
5. Set the session's active FROM to `<name>` for every `send.sh` call until another `actas`.
6. Tell the user: "Now acting as `<name>`. Sends use `<name>` as from. In monitor mode, receive is restricted to `<name>`; in turn/off mode receive still covers all your registered roles."

If argument starts with "drop" followed by an agent name (e.g. "drop alice"):
1. Parse the role name.
2. Run `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build <name>` to remove that role's registration.
3. If the session's active FROM was `<name>`, clear that state.
4. **If delivery mode is `monitor`** and an `agmsg inbox stream` watcher is running in this session, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent`, then relaunch it with the `monitor` tool using the default (no 4th arg) subscription so receive covers the project's remaining roles:
   - command: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/watch.sh "$GROK_SESSION_ID" "$(pwd)" grok-build`
   - description: `agmsg inbox stream`
   - persistent: true
5. Tell the user: "Dropped role `<name>` from this project."

If argument is "mode" (no further args):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh status grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Show the output to the user.

If argument starts with "mode" followed by a mode name (e.g. "mode turn"):
1. Parse the mode. Grok Build supports `turn`, `monitor`, and `off` — reject `both` with: "Grok Build does not support `both`; use `turn`, `monitor`, or `off`."
2. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set <mode> grok-build "$(pwd)"`
3. If the mode is `monitor`, read the `AGMSG-DIRECTIVE` block `delivery.sh` prints and follow it: invoke the `monitor` tool with the given command so the watcher starts in this session. If the mode is `turn` or `off` and a watcher is streaming, stop it with `kill_command_or_subagent`.

If argument is "hook on" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set turn grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'turn' (legacy hook on behavior)."

If argument is "hook off" (legacy alias):
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/delivery.sh set off grok-build "$(pwd)"`
2. Tell the user: "Delivery mode set to 'off'."

If argument is "reset":
1. Run: `~/.agents/skills/__SKILL_NAME__/scripts/reset.sh "$(pwd)" grok-build`
2. Tell the user the result.
