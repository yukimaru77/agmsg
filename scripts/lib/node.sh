#
# The bridge is a Node program, but a version-manager Node (nvm / fnm / volta) is
# only placed on PATH by an interactive shell's init. A bridge launched from a
# non-interactive context — e.g. a spawn boot script — therefore cannot find it
# via the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang, and the legacy Codex bridge silently
# never starts.
#
# Search order: an explicit override (AGMSG_NODE, then AGMSG_CODEX_NODE for
# back-compat) → active PATH (honours a loaded version manager) → common
# version-manager / system locations (newest nvm/fnm version first). Falls back to
# bare "node" so the behaviour is never worse than relying on PATH today (the
# caller still fails the same way, with the existing delivery.sh preflight
# warning). See #170.

  # An explicit override is authoritative — return it verbatim, even if it does
  # not exist, so the caller's preflight surfaces a misconfigured value rather
  # than silently falling back. AGMSG_NODE is the canonical name; AGMSG_CODEX_NODE
  # is kept for back-compat with the delivery.sh preflight.
