# SessionEnd hook — symmetric counterpart of session-start.sh.
#
# Usage: session-end.sh <type> <project_path>
#
# When Claude Code terminates a session (matchers: clear / resume / logout /
# prompt_input_exit / bypass_permissions_disabled / other), this script:
#   1. Reads session_id from the hook input JSON on stdin.
#   2. Kills the watch.sh process for that session via its pidfile.
#   3. Removes the matching cc-instance.<cc_pid> file if it still points at
#      this session_id, so the next SessionStart starts cleanly.
#
# Cleanup is best-effort: any missing pieces just result in nothing to do.
# The script always exits 0 — SessionEnd cannot block session termination
# anyway, and a non-zero exit would only generate noise in logs.
