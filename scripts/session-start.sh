# SessionStart hook for delivery modes `monitor` and `both`.
#
# Usage: session-start.sh <type> <project_path>
#
# Reads the hook input JSON/environment to extract the session id, then emits
# an instruction telling the host agent to invoke the Monitor tool against
# watch.sh.
#
# Before emitting the directive, this script also takes care of preventing
# duplicate watchers across `/clear` (and similar) re-fires of SessionStart
# within the same agent instance. State is kept in
# `~/.agents/agmsg/run/cc-instance.<agent_pid>`, which records the last
# session_id this agent instance attached to. On each fire we kill the watcher
# for the previous session_id, then record the new one. Multiple agent
# instances of the same project get their own agent_pid, so they never step
# on each other.
#
# Quietly exits 0 when whoami says the agent isn't joined to anything yet.
# Mode is implicit: if this script is being invoked at all, it's because
# `delivery.sh set monitor` (or `both`) installed it in the project's
# settings.local.json — that fact alone is the source of truth for "should
# we emit the directive?". No separate global mode value to consult.

This streams incoming agmsg messages into the session in real time. Each
output line is one message: \`<ts> | <team> | <from> → <to> | <body>\`.
React to messages as they arrive; reply with \`send.sh\`.

Note: On a /clear or --continue/--resume re-fire, you may shortly see a
"Monitor … stopped" notification for an earlier 'agmsg inbox stream'
task. That is the previous watcher being cleaned up to avoid duplicates
— it is expected. Do NOT relaunch it; the Monitor you invoke from this
directive replaces it.
